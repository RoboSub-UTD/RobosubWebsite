            <li>
              <strong>Emergency Stop Mechanism:</strong> Allows for immediate shutdown of the propulsion system in critical situations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Redundant Controls:</strong> Includes both wireless and physical controls for emergency power cut-off.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Protected Battery Containers:</strong> Acid-resistant, vented containers minimize risks associated with battery malfunctions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Status Indicators:</strong> LEDs and monitoring systems provide real-time feedback on system health.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Built-In Redundancy:</strong> Spare battery packs and connectors ensure operational continuity in case of component failure.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Emergency Stop Mechanism</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Luna's emergency stop mechanism is designed to immediately halt the propulsion system when required. This system uses an Arduino Mega connected to a Taranis X9D Plus transmitter via a FrSky X8R receiver. A MOSFET energizes a relay coil in a contactor, allowing or cutting off current flow based on the transmitter signal.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Additionally, a physical emergency stop button is integrated into the system. Pressing this button de-energizes the relay coil, cutting off power to the propulsion system instantly.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Redundant Power Control</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The power distribution system incorporates redundancy to ensure reliability during operation. Test leads are placed at critical points, allowing for easy diagnostics and troubleshooting. Spare connectors are included for future expansion or rapid replacement in case of failure.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Why It Matters</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            These safety and reliability measures ensure that Luna operates smoothly and safely in challenging environments. By integrating multiple layers of protection, the team has minimized risks and created a system that can adapt to unexpected scenarios.
