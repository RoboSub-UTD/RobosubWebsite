          <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Technical Details</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Luna’s battery system is designed around three battery packs:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-300">
            <li>
              <strong>4s8p Pack:</strong> Powers the four T200 thrusters,
              delivering high current output for propulsion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>4s4p Pack:</strong> Dedicated to powering onboard
              electronics via buck converters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Standby 4s4p Pack:</strong> Acts as a backup for quick
              replacement in case of failure.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The battery packs use Molicel P28A cells for their high capacity and
            reliability. Each pack is housed in an Attwood Marine 9082-1
            container, ensuring safety with features like ventilation and acid
            resistance.
          </p>

            Safety and Reliability
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The battery system is equipped with an emergency stop mechanism to
            prevent accidents. An Arduino Mega, coupled with a Taranis X9D Plus
            transmitter and FrSky X8R receiver, controls a MOSFET that energizes
            a relay coil in a contactor, allowing or cutting off current flow as
            needed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            A physical emergency stop button is also included, providing an
            additional layer of safety by immediately cutting off power in
            critical situations.
