          <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Ball Launcher</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The ball launcher utilizes a flywheel design, a proven solution in robotics for its simplicity and accuracy. This design allows for precise delivery of balls to targets while maintaining a compact form factor. The yaw and pitch control ensures flexibility during operation, enabling accurate aiming without repositioning the entire boat.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Water Launcher</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The water launcher is powered by a high-output bilge pump modified for computer actuation. This approach provides reliable and efficient water delivery for tasks requiring precise targeting. The modular integration with the ball launcher simplifies the control system while maintaining performance.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Testing and Optimization</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The launcher systems underwent extensive testing to ensure accuracy and reliability. Calibration of the yaw and pitch control mechanisms was a key focus to maximize task performance. Simulated environments were used to test launch angles, force, and precision before final integration with Luna.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Why It Matters</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            The launchers are critical for completing competition tasks. By designing systems that balance precision and reliability, Luna is equipped to handle complex challenges efficiently. The modular design ensures that future updates can enhance these systems for greater versatility.
